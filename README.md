# SBS-tech-hiring-challenge Approach 3

Deploy a Highly Available Webserver solution using a mixture of Compute, Load Balancing and other services available from AWS. 
The Solution should be self-healing, fault-tolerant as much as possible, and must make use of server-less offerings from AWS for compute.
Web-Server: Linux OS
Aim of the solution should be self-healing, fault-tolerant as much as possible, and must make use of server-less offerings from AWS for compute.
Infra used: 
  - CloudFront distribution + private S3 bucket
  Advantage: easy to implement, private s3 bucket, cache for static files
